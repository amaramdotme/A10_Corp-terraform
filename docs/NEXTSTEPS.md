## 🎯 Top Priorities (Immediate)

### 1. ✅ Verify Centralized Tagging - COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ Verified 2025-12-20
**Success**: Resources across root, dev, stage, and prod subscriptions confirmed to have correct `Environment` tags.

---

### 2. ✅ Test GitHub Actions Workflows - COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ Tested 2025-12-20
**Success**: Deployment workflows for foundation and workloads are operational with OIDC.

---

### 3. ✅ Test Workloads Destroy/Recreate - COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ Tested 2025-12-20
**Success**: Workloads can be safely destroyed and recreated without impacting foundation.

---

### 4. ✅ Initial Governance & Monitoring (Phase 1) - COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ Deployed 2025-12-20
**Deliverables**:
- Created `modules/policies` (Native Terraform).
- Enforced: Tagging (`Environment`), Location (`eastus`), Cost (`Allowed VM SKUs`), Security (`Secure Transfer`).
- Deployed: Centralized Log Analytics Workspace in Foundation (`log-a10corp-hq`).

---

### 5. ✅ Network Security & CI/CD Hardening - COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ Deployed 2025-12-20
**Deliverables**:
- **Network Security**: NSGs and Route Tables deployed to all environments (dev, stage, prod).
- **Observability**: Workload networks shipping logs to Central LAW.
- **CI/CD Security**: Integrated Trivy vulnerability scanning.
- **Automation**: Optimized CI/CD to run Plans automatically and gate only Applies.

### 6. ✅ Sales App Platform Requirements - COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ Deployed 2025-12-20
**Deliverables**:
- **Storage**: Permanent backup storage (`sta10corpsales`) with containers for all envs.
- **Governance**: Policy update to allow `eastus2` failover.
- **Networking**: Updated NSGs for AKS ingress (Port 80) and AzureLB.
- **Identity**: Granted `Storage Blob Data Contributor` to AKS identities.

---

## 🔄 Short-Term (Platform Refinement)

### 7. Security Review & Least Privilege Audit
**Status**: Next Priority
**Scope**:
- Review `Network Contributor` and `AcrPull` role assignments.
- Ensure the Workload Identities are granted minimum required access.
- Audit Policy compliance report in Azure Portal for any "Non-Compliant" existing resources.

### 7. Documentation for App Teams (Hand-off)
**Status**: Planned
**Scope**:
- Create a `PLATFORM_USER_GUIDE.md`.
- Document how external repos (App/Compute) should reference this VNet, Subnets, and Identities.
- Provide example Terraform code for App teams to "consume" these platform resources via data sources.

## 📋 Medium-Term (Optimization)

### 8. State File Migration to Terraform Cloud
**Status**: Parking Lot
**Rationale**: Evaluate if Terraform Cloud is needed for state locking or if Azure Storage + GitHub Actions is sufficient.

---

## 🅿️ Parking Lot (Future Consideration)

### 9. Naming Policy (Platform Enforcement)
**Status**: Deprioritized (Relying on Code Enforcement via `naming.tf`)
**Reason**: Conflict with Azure-generated resources.

### 10. Networking Module (Advanced)
**Status**: Parking Lot
**Scope**: Hub-and-Spoke topology, Firewall integration (if needed).

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Blockers

**None currently** - Platform Landing Zone is fully operational and ready for consumers.
