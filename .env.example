# Azure Environment Variables for Local Terraform Development
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# Usage: source .env (or use direnv)
#
# These variables are automatically set by GitHub Actions via OIDC
# For local development, they tell Terraform which subscription to use for the default provider

# Azure Subscription ID (sub-root where Key Vault lives)
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id-here"

# Azure Tenant ID
export ARM_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id-here"

# To get these values, run: az account show
